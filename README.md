An IoT Pothole Detection Setup

The idea is to detect potholes with an accelorometer, vibration sensor, and sound distance sensor, and when a pothole is successfully detected, take the GPS coordinates and send them to our server where if we get three or more pothole reports, we mark the location on a map and tweet the location over twitter.
